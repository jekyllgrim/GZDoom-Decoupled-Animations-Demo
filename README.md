# GZDoom Decoupled Animations Demo

by Agent_Ash (aka Jekyll Grim Payne0

## Description

This completely free-to-use example demonstrates the use of IQM 3D model format, specifically the use of named decoupled animations supported by this format.

Contents:

* IQM model. The model is a simple animated cube that uses Doom 2 map textures (not included with the example; they will be picked by the model when loaded into the game automatically).

* The original .blend model (created with Blender 4.3; may not be compatible with earlier versions)

* A ZScript definition for a custom monster using the aforementioned model. Comes with Spawn, See, Melee, Missile, Pain and Death state sequences. Has no sounds.

* MODELDEF definition for the monster.

* TEXTURES definition containing a single dummy sprite used by the monster.

Lee Salzman's IQM plugin was used to export the model from Blender: https://github.com/lsalzman/iqm
